# PayPal Donate Button


Donate button with similar layout to Google Play and F-Droid

## :question: What's up here?

The target of this project is to create a beautiful button, that can be used by open source projects (e. g. on GitHub or GitLab) to display a donate button similar to Google Play Store and F-Droid button.

## :exclamation: But - Why?!

Because the buttons, PayPal offers do not fit to other buttons which are often next to the PayPal Donate Button. Best example are apps which are available for Play Store, F-Droid or Appstore.

## :eyes: Demonstration
